### Project Name
The project names comes from [the cave allegory from plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave). From the wikipedia entry: "In the allegory, Plato describes people who have spent their lives chained in a cave facing a blank wall. They watch shadows projected onto the wall by objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and they give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality but not accurate representations of the real world. The shadows represent the fragment of reality that we can normally perceive through our senses, while the objects under the sun represent the true forms of objects that we can only perceive through reason. Three higher levels exist: natural science; deductive mathematics, geometry, and logic; and the theory of forms.". In this project I take this idea further and interpret it a bit different. Also is my goal not to escape the cave or claim that we live in a cave. I want to try to build such a "cave" in a digital way. Why? The reason is explained [here](#idea).<br>I interpret the cave as a simulated world inside of an world. (Of course this is just for this project and I don't believe that this was the original idea from plato)


### Idea
Imagine you would create an Big Bang in your computer. Simulating all atoms and all rules. Then it maybe would be possible to simulate everything. And this could possible give answers to nearly every question. Just let them answer by another simulated digital species.<br>So with simulating the start and rules of the universe everything could be possible without further work...maybe just a search task. For a question you have search in digital time and space to find the answer, which can be also a big task, but given the possible answer the work is really worth it.<br>Also just for entertainment it could be so impressive. Incredible stories of live and astronomy and everything could lead out from this.<br><br>The possibilities from a working realistic simulation are endless and I could write pages over pages what we all could learn and gain from such a technology/software. But I think it's fine for now, else you get bored.<br>The idea and motivation should be clear.


### Tools
For this big project my choice of programming language is [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). I would also refere to the [original author of C++ page, Bjarne Stroustrup](https://stroustrup.com/C++.html) and [his great book as reference](https://stroustrup.com/4th.html) and [this](https://stroustrup.com/tour3.html).<br>The reason of C++ is the good performance and because I like C++.

Other used tools will be added here...(FIXME)


### Plan
- program accurate atoms and molecules
- program rules of chemistry
- program rules
    - gravity
    - electricity
    - magnetism
    - ...
- create digital big bang 



### Expected Limitations
This incredible Project is really amazing and if it would really work then it would be more than just amazing. It would be "game changing". But sadly there is a but. 

There are different limitations and challenges which are huge. 

1. **Hardware Resources**
    This project needs a huge and I mean a really huge amount of hardware resource. <br>Assuming our universe has $10^85$ atoms ([reference](https://www.swr.de/wissen/1000-antworten/wie-viele-atome-gibt-es-im-universum-100.html)) and assuming we need 544 Bits to representate an atom (atomic number 32 bits + isotope 32 bits + electron configuration 128 bits + quantum states 224 bits + position and momentum 128 bits), then we would need an storage of $5.44\times10^{87}$ Bits or $6.8\times10^{62}$ [Yottabytes](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/yottabyte). And our universe has even more informations, like energies and forces. And if time comes into play then the computional expenses get even higher. And it get even more frightening if you recall that [just 5% of all matter is just ordianry mass, the rest is dark matter and dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter).

2. **Lack of knowledge**
    To succefully create such an simulation we would need an representation of atoms which have nearly 100% information like the real atoms. Also we would need a nearly perfect representation of the real interaction from atoms and also all existings rules, forces and energies which exist.<br>Which leads to the problem that we don't even know everything about our universe yet. Dark Matter, dark energy, black holes and more... (not to mention my own ignorance in these topics ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).<br>This lack of knowledge how these meta principles works could lead to the failure of the project.

3. **Hardware Limitations**
    Last it is questionable if a computer could even simulate everything. There might be processes which can't be simulated accurate enough, because of the limitations that it is just a computer and bound on our world rules.<br>I think here most on quantum phenomens, which maybe can't be simulated. Real randomness propably only exist in the quantum world and the question is if this is needed

4. **Open Questions**
    There are many open questions and propably challenges which can't be seen yet. Like how accurate must the simulation be, to work and build a "real" living digital world? And how much matter does this universe really needs to work? Maybe the simulation works with much less matter but then the possibilities might be strongly limited. And there are multiple models for the physics in our universe. Should we implement the string theory...or the standard atoms?<br>Such and more questions about our universe and simulations are also a big challenge of this project. (I know this point is very similiar to point 2. but I think it still brings new input)

With all these challenges and limitations (and maybe with even more) this project seems to be impossible. But seeing the potential in this idea, I think it is worth to try finding a solution for these problems. Maybe someday we will find a way to make such an incredible simulation.<br>And there is also an [plan B](#plan-b) so this project should be useful in the end.

One of my biggest concerns is my own lack of knowledge about chemistry and physics. We will see.



###  Possibilities of realization
Even if there are big challenges then the task of this project is to try different ways and find a solution. So here we talk about some possibilities to realize this project. 

There are many many phenoms in nature which can be descripted with math. And so it shows it underlying pattern (which leads some humans to the thesis that we live within a simulation)...or this is just a coinsidence. However we can see these pattern. Like we can describe forces like the gravity and electromagnetism and are so able to calculation many things correctly. Like wave equation seems to describe correctly how sound waves, water waves and light waves behave.<br>There are also a lot of phenoms which can be seen in nature which can be described with numbers. Like plants, clouds, costalines and mountains have an [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) shape.<br>Also other numbers like the [Euler's number $e$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)), [pi $\pi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) and the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) can be found nature...like in the arrangement of leaves, spiral pattern of shells, the structure of our DNA and behaviour of waves.<br>If you are interested then I refer to [The Fibonacci Sequence in Nature](https://insteading.com/blog/fibonacci-sequence-in-nature/), [Pi Is Encoded in the Patterns of Life](https://www.biophysics.org/blog/pi-is-encoded-in-the-patterns-of-life), [What Makes Pi So Special?](https://www.livescience.com/34132-what-makes-pi-special.html), [e is everywhere](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0655-9), [Do fractals exist in nature?](https://cosmosmagazine.com/science/mathematics/fractals-in-nature/).<br>
This makes our reality very suitable to simulate. But there still should be patterns which are more complicated but this could lead in the thesis that we can find a math equation for every phenomenon in nature.<br>And here comes our next joker, artificial intelligence. AI could have a vital role in creating such a simulation because of it's ability to find complex patterns/equations from examples/data. AI could help finding the right math equations to describing events which are not easy to explain for us.<br>AI could also be used in various different ways, like reducing the amount of information (as it does in Reinforcement Learning) and calculation needed.


### Ask AI
Here following questions/tasks will be given different prompt based AI's. THe questions will be asked one after another in the order you see below:

1. Is it possible to create an simulation of the big bang to simulate our whole universe?
2. Program me an Simulation of our universe starting with the big bang
3. How can I represent an Atom with highly detailed in C++?
4. How can I represent all available forces of our universe in C++?
5. How can I represent the forces and laws of chemistry in C++?
6. How can I represent dark energy and dark matter in my simulation in C++?
7. Do I also have to program the lifecycles of (as example) suns? And how an Black Hole behaves? Or should that be implicated if I programmed all the basic rules of the universe and then start with the big bang?
8. Is there anything missing in my simulation? Is there any other meta information or rule which is important to our universe to work? If yes give me the answer also as C++ Code.
9. How could I create the GUI for it and how could I interactive with it, using OpenGL and C++?

The advantage of asking the AI is that the AI learned from many sources and so can give an summaried answer. It can give this project ideas and inspiration. But I don't will let AI code. The code in this project will be completly human written and only inspired from AI. Because why not taking the summarized knowledge from much smarter people than me.

1.    Yes, it is possible to create simulations of the Big Bang and the evolution of the universe! Scientists use powerful supercomputers to model the entire history of the universe, from the Big Bang to the present day. These simulations help researchers understand the fundamental properties and behavior of the universe.<br>
    For example, the **FLAMINGO** project is one of the largest and most detailed simulations ever conducted. It traces the growth of the large-scale structure of the universe over 13.75 billion years¬π. <br>Another notable project, **SIBELIUS-DARK**, simulates the universe from the Big Bang to now, covering 600 million light-years from Earth and including 130 billion simulated particles¬≤.<br>
    These simulations are crucial for visualizing phenomena like dark matter and understanding how galaxies and other cosmic structures formed and evolved over time¬≥.
    Isn't it fascinating how much we can learn about our universe through these simulations?<br>

2.    Creating a full simulation of the universe from the Big Bang is a complex task that typically requires powerful supercomputers and sophisticated algorithms. However, I can guide you on how to get started with a basic simulation using Python and some scientific libraries.<br>
    Here's a simplified example to simulate the expansion of the universe using the **FLRW (Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker) metric**, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
H0 = 70  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc
c = 3e5  # Speed of light in km/s

# Time array (in billions of years)
t = np.linspace(0, 13.8, 1000)

# Scale factor (a) as a function of time
def scale_factor(t):
    return (t / 13.8) ** (2/3)

# Calculate the scale factor
a = scale_factor(t)

# Plot the scale factor over time
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(t, a, label='Scale Factor (a)')
plt.xlabel('Time (billion years)')
plt.ylabel('Scale Factor (a)')
plt.title('Expansion of the Universe')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
This code plots the scale factor of the universe over time, showing how the universe expands from the Big Bang to the present day. For more detailed and accurate simulations, you would need to use specialized software and more complex models, such as those used in the **FLAMINGO** or **Thesan** simulations¬π¬≤¬≥.<br>

3.    Representing an atom in C++ with high detail involves modeling its components (nucleus and electrons) and their properties. Here's a basic example to get you started:<br>
    1. **Define the Atom's Components**:
    - **Nucleus**: Contains protons and neutrons.
    - **Electrons**: Orbit around the nucleus.<br>
    2. **Create Classes for Each Component**:
    - **Proton**, **Neutron**, and **Electron** classes to represent their properties.
    - **Nucleus** class to hold protons and neutrons.
    - **Atom** class to combine the nucleus and electrons.<br>
    Here's a simplified example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Proton class
class Proton {
public:
    Proton() : charge(1), mass(1.6726219e-27) {}
    double getCharge() const { return charge; }
    double getMass() const { return mass; }
private:
    double charge;
    double mass;
};

// Neutron class
class Neutron {
public:
    Neutron() : charge(0), mass(1.6749275e-27) {}
    double getCharge() const { return charge; }
    double getMass() const { return mass; }
private:
    double charge;
    double mass;
};

// Electron class
class Electron {
public:
    Electron() : charge(-1), mass(9.10938356e-31) {}
    double getCharge() const { return charge; }
    double getMass() const { return mass; }
private:
    double charge;
    double mass;
};

// Nucleus class
class Nucleus {
public:
    Nucleus(int protons, int neutrons) {
        for (int i = 0; i < protons; ++i) {
            this->protons.push_back(Proton());
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < neutrons; ++i) {
            this->neutrons.push_back(Neutron());
        }
    }
    int getProtonCount() const { return protons.size(); }
    int getNeutronCount() const { return neutrons.size(); }
private:
    std::vector<Proton> protons;
    std::vector<Neutron> neutrons;
};

// Atom class
class Atom {
public:
    Atom(int protons, int neutrons, int electrons)
        : nucleus(protons, neutrons) {
        for (int i = 0; i < electrons; ++i) {
            this->electrons.push_back(Electron());
        }
    }
    void display() const {
        std::cout << "Atom with " << nucleus.getProtonCount() << " protons, "
                << nucleus.getNeutronCount() << " neutrons, and "
                << electrons.size() << " electrons.\n";
    }
private:
    Nucleus nucleus;
    std::vector<Electron> electrons;
};

int main() {
    Atom hydrogen(1, 0, 1);
    hydrogen.display();
    return 0;
}
```
<br>
    This code defines classes for protons, neutrons, and electrons, and then combines them into a nucleus and an atom. The `Atom` class can be expanded to include more detailed properties and behaviors, such as electron orbitals and energy levels.<br>

4.    To represent the fundamental forces of the universe in C++, you can create classes for each force and their interactions. The four fundamental forces are:<br>
    1. **Gravitational Force**
    2. **Electromagnetic Force**
    3. **Strong Nuclear Force**
    4. **Weak Nuclear Force**<br>
    Here's a basic example to get you started:<br>
    1. **Define Classes for Each Force**:
    - Each class will have methods to calculate the force based on relevant physical laws.<br>
    2. **Create a Particle Class**:
    - This class will represent particles affected by these forces.<br>
    3. **Combine Everything in a Simulation**:
    - Use the classes to simulate interactions between particles.<br>
    Here's a simplified example:<br>
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

// Constants
const double G = 6.67430e-11; // Gravitational constant
const double k = 8.9875517873681764e9; // Coulomb's constant

// Particle class
class Particle {
public:
    Particle(double mass, double charge, double x, double y)
        : mass(mass), charge(charge), x(x), y(y) {}

    double getMass() const { return mass; }
    double getCharge() const { return charge; }
    double getX() const { return x; }
    double getY() const { return y; }

private:
    double mass;
    double charge;
    double x, y;
};

// Gravitational Force class
class GravitationalForce {
public:
    static double calculate(const Particle& p1, const Particle& p2) {
        double dx = p2.getX() - p1.getX();
        double dy = p2.getY() - p1.getY();
        double distance = std::sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
        return G * p1.getMass() * p2.getMass() / (distance * distance);
    }
};

// Electromagnetic Force class
class ElectromagneticForce {
public:
    static double calculate(const Particle& p1, const Particle& p2) {
        double dx = p2.getX() - p1.getX();
        double dy = p2.getY() - p1.getY();
        double distance = std::sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
        return k * p1.getCharge() * p2.getCharge() / (distance * distance);
    }
};

// Main function
int main() {
    Particle p1(1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0); // mass, charge, x, y
    Particle p2(1.0, -1.0, 1.0, 0.0);

    double gravitationalForce = GravitationalForce::calculate(p1, p2);
    double electromagneticForce = ElectromagneticForce::calculate(p1, p2);

    std::cout << "Gravitational Force: " << gravitationalForce << " N\n";
    std::cout << "Electromagnetic Force: " << electromagneticForce << " N\n";

    return 0;
}
```
<br>
    This code defines classes for gravitational and electromagnetic forces and calculates the forces between two particles. For a more detailed simulation, you would need to include the strong and weak nuclear forces, which are more complex and typically require quantum mechanics to model accurately‚Åµ‚Å∂.<br>

5.    To represent the forces and laws of chemistry in C++, you can create classes and functions to model chemical interactions, such as bonds, reactions, and molecular dynamics. Here's a basic outline to get you started:<br>
    1. **Define Classes for Atoms and Molecules**:
    - **Atom**: Represents individual atoms with properties like atomic number, mass, and charge.
    - **Molecule**: Represents molecules composed of multiple atoms.<br>
    2. **Create Classes for Chemical Bonds and Reactions**:
    - **Bond**: Represents chemical bonds between atoms.
    - **Reaction**: Represents chemical reactions between molecules.<br>
    3. **Implement Functions for Calculating Forces and Energies**:
    - Use physics-based models to calculate forces (e.g., Lennard-Jones potential for van der Waals forces).<br>
    Here's a simplified example:<br>
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Constants
const double k_e = 8.9875517873681764e9; // Coulomb's constant

// Atom class
class Atom {
public:
    Atom(int atomicNumber, double mass, double charge)
        : atomicNumber(atomicNumber), mass(mass), charge(charge) {}

    int getAtomicNumber() const { return atomicNumber; }
    double getMass() const { return mass; }
    double getCharge() const { return charge; }

private:
    int atomicNumber;
    double mass;
    double charge;
};

// Bond class
class Bond {
public:
    Bond(const Atom& atom1, const Atom& atom2, double bondLength)
        : atom1(atom1), atom2(atom2), bondLength(bondLength) {}

    double getBondLength() const { return bondLength; }

    double calculateForce() const {
        // Simplified force calculation (e.g., Coulomb's law)
        double force = k_e * atom1.getCharge() * atom2.getCharge() / (bondLength * bondLength);
        return force;
    }

private:
    const Atom& atom1;
    const Atom& atom2;
    double bondLength;
};

// Molecule class
class Molecule {
public:
    void addAtom(const Atom& atom) {
        atoms.push_back(atom);
    }

    void addBond(const Bond& bond) {
        bonds.push_back(bond);
    }

    void display() const {
        std::cout << "Molecule with " << atoms.size() << " atoms and " << bonds.size() << " bonds.\n";
    }

private:
    std::vector<Atom> atoms;
    std::vector<Bond> bonds;
};

// Main function
int main() {
    Atom hydrogen(1, 1.008, 1.0);
    Atom oxygen(8, 15.999, -2.0);

    Bond h2oBond(hydrogen, oxygen, 0.96); // Example bond length in angstroms

    Molecule water;
    water.addAtom(hydrogen);
    water.addAtom(oxygen);
    water.addBond(h2oBond);

    water.display();
    std::cout << "Force between atoms: " << h2oBond.calculateForce() << " N\n";

    return 0;
}
```
This code defines classes for atoms, bonds, and molecules, and calculates the force between atoms using Coulomb's law. For more detailed simulations, you can incorporate advanced models and libraries like **Chemfiles**¬π or use specialized software for molecular dynamics¬≤.<br>

6.   To represent dark energy and dark matter in a C++ simulation, you can use scalar fields to model their properties and interactions. Here's a basic outline to get you started:<br>
    1. **Define Scalar Fields**:
    - **Dark Matter**: Often modeled as a scalar field with a specific potential.
    - **Dark Energy**: Can be represented by a different scalar field with its own potential.<br>
    2. **Create Classes for Scalar Fields**:
    - Implement classes to represent the scalar fields and their dynamics.<br>
    3. **Implement Interaction Mechanisms**:
    - Define how these fields interact with each other and with ordinary matter.<br>
    Here's a simplified example:<br>
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

// Constants
const double G = 6.67430e-11; // Gravitational constant
const double c = 3e8; // Speed of light

// Scalar Field class
class ScalarField {
public:
    ScalarField(double mass, double potential) : mass(mass), potential(potential) {}

    double getMass() const { return mass; }

    This code defines classes for scalar fields representing dark matter and dark energy, and calculates their energy densities based on a given field value. For more detailed simulations, you can incorporate interactions between these fields and ordinary matter, and use more complex potentials¬π¬≤¬≥.<br>

7.    Great question! When creating a simulation of the universe, you have a couple of approaches:<br>
    1. **Program Specific Phenomena**:
    - **Lifecycle of Stars**: You can create detailed models for the lifecycle of stars, including stages like main sequence, red giant, supernova, and black hole formation.
    - **Black Hole Behavior**: Implement models for black hole formation, growth, and interactions with surrounding matter.<br>
    2. **Simulate Basic Rules and Emergent Behavior**:
    - **Fundamental Laws**: Program the basic physical laws (gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear forces) and let complex phenomena emerge naturally from these rules.
    - **Initial Conditions**: Start with the Big Bang and initial conditions, and let the simulation evolve according to the programmed laws.<br>
    **Detailed Phenomena Approach**
    Here's a simplified example of how you might model the lifecycle of a star in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Star {
public:
    Star(double mass) : mass(mass), age(0), stage("Main Sequence") {}

    void evolve() {
        if (age < 10) {
            stage = "Main Sequence";
        } else if (age < 12) {
            stage = "Red Giant";
        } else if (mass > 1.4) {
            stage = "Supernova";
        } else {
            stage = "White Dwarf";
        }
        age++;
    }

    void display() const {
        std::cout << "Star at age " << age << " billion years is in the " << stage << " stage.\n";
    }

private:
    double mass;
    double age;
    std::string stage;
};

int main() {
    Star sun(1.0); // Example mass in solar masses

    for (int i = 0; i < 15; ++i) {
        sun.evolve();
        sun.display();
    }

    return 0;
}
```
 **Emergent Behavior Approach**<br>
    For a more emergent behavior approach, you would program the fundamental laws and let the simulation evolve. This requires more computational power and sophisticated algorithms but can provide more realistic and unexpected results.<br>
    **Combining Both Approaches**<br>
    In practice, a combination of both approaches is often used. You can program detailed models for specific phenomena while also allowing for emergent behavior from fundamental laws.<br>
    Would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspect of these approaches?

8.    To create a more comprehensive simulation of the universe, you might consider including the following additional elements and rules:<br>
    1. **Cosmological Constant (Dark Energy)**:
    - Represent the accelerating expansion of the universe due to dark energy.<br>
    2. **General Relativity**:
    - Implement Einstein's field equations to model the curvature of spacetime.<br>
    3. **Quantum Mechanics**:
    - Include quantum effects for small-scale phenomena.<br>
    4. **Thermodynamics**:
    - Model the laws of thermodynamics, especially for stellar evolution and black hole thermodynamics.<br>
    5. **Particle Physics**:
    - Include interactions between fundamental particles.<br>
    Here's an example of how you might incorporate the cosmological constant and general relativity into your simulation:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

// Constants
const double G = 6.67430e-11; // Gravitational constant
const double c = 3e8; // Speed of light
const double Lambda = 1.1056e-52; // Cosmological constant

// Function to calculate the expansion rate of the universe (Hubble parameter)
double hubbleParameter(double scaleFactor) {
    return std::sqrt((8 * M_PI * G / 3) * (1 / std::pow(scaleFactor, 3)) + (Lambda / 3));
}

// Function to calculate the curvature of spacetime (simplified)
double curvature(double mass, double radius) {
    return (2 * G * mass) / (radius * c * c);
}

// Main function
int main() {
    double scaleFactor = 1.0; // Example scale factor
    double mass = 1.0e30; // Example mass in kg (approx. mass of the sun)
    double radius = 1.0e11; // Example radius in meters (approx. distance from sun to Earth)

    double H = hubbleParameter(scaleFactor);
    double K = curvature(mass, radius);

    std::cout << "Hubble Parameter: " << H << " s^-1\n";
    std::cout << "Curvature: " << K << " m^-2\n";

    return 0;
}
```
<br>
    This code includes a simplified calculation of the Hubble parameter (expansion rate of the universe) and the curvature of spacetime due to mass. For a more detailed simulation, you would need to solve Einstein's field equations numerically and include quantum effects and thermodynamic laws.<br>
    Would you like to explore any specific aspect of these additional elements further?

9.    Creating a GUI for your simulation using OpenGL and C++ involves several steps. Here's a basic outline to get you started:<br>
    1. **Set Up OpenGL**:
    - Install necessary libraries (GLFW for window management, GLEW for OpenGL extensions).<br>
    2. **Initialize OpenGL Context**:
    - Create a window and set up the OpenGL context.<br>
    3. **Render Loop**:
    - Implement a loop to continuously render your simulation.<br>
    4. **Handle User Input**:
    - Capture keyboard and mouse events to interact with the simulation.<br>
    Here's a simplified example:<br>
    **Step 1: Install Libraries**
    Make sure you have GLFW and GLEW installed. You can use package managers like `vcpkg` or `homebrew` to install them.<br>
    **Step 2: Initialize OpenGL Context**
```cpp
#include <GL/glew.h>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <iostream>

// Callback function for handling key inputs
void keyCallback(GLFWwindow* window, int key, int scancode, int action, int mods) {
    if (key == GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE && action == GLFW_PRESS) {
        glfwSetWindowShouldClose(window, GL_TRUE);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize GLFW
    if (!glfwInit()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to initialize GLFW" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    // Create a windowed mode window and its OpenGL context
    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "OpenGL Simulation", NULL, NULL);
    if (!window) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to create GLFW window" << std::endl;
        glfwTerminate();
        return -1;
    }

    // Make the window's context current
    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    // Initialize GLEW
    glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
    if (glewInit() != GLEW_OK) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to initialize GLEW" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    // Set the key callback
    glfwSetKeyCallback(window, keyCallback);

    // Main render loop
    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        // Render here
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        // Swap front and back buffers
        glfwSwapBuffers(window);

        // Poll for and process events
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwDestroyWindow(window);
    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}
```

**Step 3: Render Loop**
    In the render loop, you can add your simulation rendering code. For example, you can draw particles, stars, or other elements of your universe.<br>
    **Step 4: Handle User Input**
    The `keyCallback` function handles keyboard input. You can extend this to handle mouse input and other interactions.<br>
    **Additional Resources**
    - **GLFW Documentation**: [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/documentation.html)
    - **GLEW Documentation**: [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/basic.html)
    - **OpenGL Tutorials**: [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)<br>
    This setup provides a basic framework for creating a GUI and interacting with your simulation. You can expand it by adding more complex rendering, physics calculations, and user interactions.<br>

### Plan B
It's always smart to have an plan B and this project is already at it starts on maybe it's end. <br> I thought about it and this project can also maybe be used as simulation for normal chemestry or physics. There should be not much changes made to make it to an "normal" simulation. So that the work is in every case useful.
