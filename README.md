### Project Name
The project names comes from [the cave allegory from plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave). From the wikipedia entry: "In the allegory, Plato describes people who have spent their lives chained in a cave facing a blank wall. They watch shadows projected onto the wall by objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and they give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality but not accurate representations of the real world. The shadows represent the fragment of reality that we can normally perceive through our senses, while the objects under the sun represent the true forms of objects that we can only perceive through reason. Three higher levels exist: natural science; deductive mathematics, geometry, and logic; and the theory of forms.". In this project I take this idea further and interpret it a bit different. Also is my goal not to escape the cave or claim that we live in a cave. I want to try to build such a "cave" in a digital way. Why? The reason is explained [here](#idea).<br>I interpret the cave as a simulated world inside of an world. (Of course this is just for this project and I don't believe that this was the original idea from plato)


### Idea
Image you would create an Big Bang in your computer. Simulating all atoms and all rules. Then it maybe would be possible to simulate everything. And this could possible give answers to nearly every question. Just let them answer by another simulated digital species.<br>So with simulating the start and rules of the universe everything could be possible without further work...maybe just a search task. For a question you have search in digital time and space to find the answer, which can be also a big task, but given the possible answer the work is really worth it.<br>Also just for entertainment it could be so impressive. Incredible stories of live and astronomy and everything could lead out from this.<br><br>The possibilities from a working realistic simulation are endless and I could write pages over pages what we all could learn and gain from such a technology/software. But I think it's fine for now, else you get bored.<br>The idea and motivation should be clear.


### Tools
For this big project my choice of programming language is [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). I would also refere to the [original author of C++ page, Bjarne Stroustrup](https://stroustrup.com/C++.html) and [his great book as reference](https://stroustrup.com/4th.html) and [this](https://stroustrup.com/tour3.html).<br>The reason of C++ is the good performance and because I like C++.

Other used tools will be added here...(FIXME)


### Plan



### Expected Limitations
This incredible Project is really amazing and if it would really work then it would be more than just amazing. It would be "game changing". But sadly there is a but. 

There are different limitations and challenges which are huge. 

1. **Hardware Resources**
    This project needs a huge and I mean a really huge amount of hardware resource. <br>Assuming our universe has $10^85$ atoms ([reference](https://www.swr.de/wissen/1000-antworten/wie-viele-atome-gibt-es-im-universum-100.html)) and assuming we need 544 Bits to representate an atom (atomic number 32 bits + isotope 32 bits + electron configuration 128 bits + quantum states 224 bits + position and momentum 128 bits), then we would need an storage of $5.44\times10^{87}$ Bits or $6.8\times10^{62}$ [Yottabytes](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/yottabyte). And our universe has even more informations, like energies and forces. And if time comes into play then the computional expenses get even higher. And it get even more frightening if you recall that [just 5% of all matter is just ordianry mass, the rest is dark matter and dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter).

2. **Lack of knowledge**
    To succefully create such an simulation we would need an representation of atoms which have nearly 100% information like the real atoms. Also we would need a nearly perfect representation of the real interaction from atoms and also all existings rules, forces and energies which exist.<br>Which leads to the problem that we don't even know everything about our universe yet. Dark Matter, dark energy, black holes and more... (not to mention my own ignorance in these topics ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).<br>This lack of knowledge how these meta principles works could lead to the failure of the project.

3. **Hardware Limitations**
    Last it is questionable if a computer could even simulate everything. There might be processes which can't be simulated accurate enough, because of the limitations that it is just a computer and bound on our world rules.<br>I think here most on quantum phenomens, which maybe can't be simulated. Real randomness propably only exist in the quantum world and the question is if this is needed

4. **Open Questions**
    There are many open questions and propably challenges which can't be seen yet. Like how accurate must the simulation be, to work and build a "real" living digital world? And how much matter does this universe really needs to work? Maybe the simulation works with much less matter but then the possibilities might be strongly limited. And there are multiple models for the physics in our universe. Should we implement the string theory...or the standard atoms?<br>Such and more questions about our universe and simulations are also a big challenge of this project. (I know this point is very similiar to point 2. but I think it still brings new input)

With all these challenges and limitations (and maybe with even more) this project seems to be impossible. But seeing the potential in this idea, I think it is worth to try finding a solution for these problems. Maybe someday we will find a way to make such an incredible simulation.<br>And there is also an [plan B](#plan-b) so this project should be useful in the end.

One of my biggest concerns is my own lack of knowledge about chemistry and physics. We will see.



###  Possibilities of realization
Even if there are big challenges then the task of this project is to try different ways and find a solution. So here we talk about some possibilities to realize this project. 

There are many many phenoms in nature which can be descripted with math. And so it shows it underlying pattern (which leads some humans to the thesis that we live within a simulation)...or this is just a coinsidence. However we can see these pattern. Like we can describe forces like the gravity and electromagnetism and are so able to calculation many things correctly. Like wave equation seems to describe correctly how sound waves, water waves and light waves behave.<br>There are also a lot of phenoms which can be seen in nature which can be described with numbers. Like plants, clouds, costalines and mountains have an [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) shape.<br>Also other numbers like the [Euler's number $e$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)), [pi $\pi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) and the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) can be found nature...like in the arrangement of leaves, spiral pattern of shells, the structure of our DNA and behaviour of waves.<br>If you are interested then I refer to [The Fibonacci Sequence in Nature](https://insteading.com/blog/fibonacci-sequence-in-nature/), [Pi Is Encoded in the Patterns of Life](https://www.biophysics.org/blog/pi-is-encoded-in-the-patterns-of-life), [What Makes Pi So Special?](https://www.livescience.com/34132-what-makes-pi-special.html), [e is everywhere](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0655-9), [Do fractals exist in nature?](https://cosmosmagazine.com/science/mathematics/fractals-in-nature/).<br>
This makes our reality very suitable to simulate. But there still should be patterns which are more complicated but this could lead in the thesis that we can find a math equation for every phenomenon in nature.<br>And here comes our next joker, artificial intelligence. AI could have a vital role in creating such a simulation because of it's ability to find complex patterns/equations from examples/data. AI could help finding the right math equations to describing events which are not easy to explain for us.<br>AI could also be used in various different ways, like reducing the amount of information (as it does in Reinforcement Learning) and calculation needed.


### Ask AI
Here following questions/tasks will be given different prompt based AI's. THe questions will be asked one after another in the order you see below:

- Is it possible to create an simulation of the big bang to simulate our whole universe?
- Program me an Simulation of our universe starting with the big bang
- How can I represent an Atom with highly detailed in C++?
- How can I represent all available forces of our universe in C++?
- How can I represent dark energy and dark matter in my simulation in C++?
- Do I also have to program the lifecycles of (as example) suns? And how an Black Hole behaves? Or should that be implicated if I programmed all the basic rules of the universe and then start with the big bang?
- Is there anything missing in my simulation? Is there any other meta information or rule which is important to our universe to work? If yes give me the answer also as C++ Code.

### Plan B
It's always smart to have an plan B and this project is already at it starts on maybe it's end. <br> I thought about it and this project can also maybe be used as simulation for normal chemestry or physics. There should be not much changes made to make it to an "normal" simulation. So that the work is in every case useful.
